# 1. Hello World

## What is this?

A (hopefully) weekly updated blog where I write about the journey of developing my first indie game.

## Who are you!?

Hi my name is Philip, I am a developer/consultant by day but by night ... I sleep, I have 3 kids under 6 so I need my sleep! But in the few hours between the kids going to bed and me passing out from exhaustion I make indie games.

## What can I expect to read on this blog?

My goal is to use as few libraries as possible, and to not use one of the big engines. Why? Well, one because I want to learn, and two, i want this to be as broad a blog that applies to as many different solutions as possible. I know that I could do things faster if I didn’t build as much myself, but I am doing this for fun, not for profit.
I plan to use Rust as my programming language (because it seems well suited for game development), SDL2 for Input/Output and cross platform support, also I don’t plan on building my own ECS.

If you are are currently thinking:

![hmm yeah i know some of these words](https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/80485764.jpg)

Then don’t worry, I will explain my choices and what Rust, SDL2 and ECS is :-)

Whenever I make a post, I will share links to anything I have found and code snippets to show solutions. If i read a good relevant book I might also post that too.

## Why are you writing this blog?
The main goal is to share my: findings, interesting links and solutions to problems, so that other developers out there don’t have to “stumble” around looking for the answers like I did.
Another goal is that having this weekly check-in will “keep me to the fire”, you will all be my “accountability partners”.

## Why should I read your blog?
In my blog i will probably write about how I was ignorant or stupid, hopefully I will stumble into something that other beginners will also struggle with and then we can find a solution together.
